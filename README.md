# Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) Implementation in Verilog(Xilinx)-
### Problem Statement-
We have to design Encryption and Decryption scheme for following modes of operation on Advanced Encryption Standard **(AES-128)**:
1) Electronic Code Book Mode
2) Cipher Block Chaining Mode
3) Cipher Feedback Mode
4) Output Feedback Mode

And we have to implement these all modes on a input image i.e. we have to encrypt a given image using different modes of operation on AES.

### Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)-
You can study about AES from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fXcfTqueZp4jEbvJ7aREmucFXVnKPwJU/view?usp=sharing) and about different modes of operation from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sOd31YbFAfZne7c2WQ0h9owgZI_9_66C/view?usp=sharing) or you can read [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1COexFHtUOkY0hctzP4QFXxKHtCyYmSTj/view?usp=sharing) also.

### Approach-
We have an [image]() as input. But we can run our verilog code only on binary input so first we have to convert the given image to binary format using a [python code]().
